        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Diablo 2 is quite an old game. But is still one of my favorite games to ever be created. Recently it had a patch go live to make it easier for people to install diablo on modern machines. Although these patches are not 100% fool proof so this guide will hopefully solve all your issues you may be having with installation.</p>
        <h3>Things you are going to need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy of Diablo II and/or it expansion CD keys.</li>
            <li>A laptop/Destop with winodws 10/7 (This is geared towards a windows 10 tutorial)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instillation Process</h2>
        <h3>Getting CD Key</h3>
        <p>If you dont already have a copy of the game, or do but have lost the CD key to your game you will have to purchase one online <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/diablo-ii">Here</a>.</p>
            <p id="location"></p>
            <script> document.getElementById("location").innerHTML = "Page location is: " + window.location;</script>
            <p id="href"></p>

            <script> document.getElementById("hostname").innerHTML = "Page hostname is: " + window.location.hostname;</script>
            <p id="pathname"></p>
            <script> document.getElementById("pathname").innerHTML = "Page pathname is: " + window.location.pathname;</script>

        <h2>INSERT PITCURE</h2>
        <p>You are going to have to create an account to purchase the game. But no worries once you do, you will have set up your account for online mutiplayer aswell!</p>
        <p>Once you have created an account and purchased the game you can acces the CD key from your Games & Subscriptions in your account settings.</p>
        <h2>INSERT PICTURE</h2>
        <h3>Installing Installer</h3>
        <p>Once you have your Cd Keys we will next install the installer which can be found right next to the CD keys ealier.</p>
        <h2>INSERT PICTURE</h2>
        <p>You will want to download Diablo base game first even if you have both CD KEYS. When promted make sure to download it to your windows desktop to make finding it easier.</p>
        <h2>INSERT PICTURE</h2>
        <p>Once installed begin running the downlaoded launcher, make sure to run it in adminisstrative mode as someyimes it can cause some issues if you dont. To do this you simply right click the program and select properties at the very bottom. Once the properties window is open you will notice multipule headers, you will want to clikc on the compatibility one. In the settings box you will see "Run this program as an administrator". Select aht option, click apply then ok. When running the program it will ask to run in administrative mode from now on. </p>
        <h2>INSERT MANY PICTURES</h2>
        <p>When selecting a destination folder you will want to select MY PC-LOCAL DISK-Program files x86 or 64</p>
        <p>ONce installation is complete it will ask for your name and your CD keys. Unfortunatly at the moment I cannot get my computer to ask for my CD keys so i cannot show you a picture.</p>
        <p>Once you have completed these step you can now begin playing Diablo 2. If you have the expansion you will do these steps again but with the expansion launcher found directly underneath the regular Diablo installer <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/">Here</a></p>
        
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>Sometimes when trying to run the game you can have multipule problems including wrong colors or even not being able to run it at all.</p>
        <h3>Wrong colors</h3>
        <p>This can be fixed easily by selecting the properties option on the game icon and in compatibility tab select the check box reduce coloer mode and begin running through the options until the color issues are fixed. If this doe snot help you may want to run the game in windowed mode which you can do by simply adding a -w at the end of the game name under general tab.</p>
        <h2>INSERT PIC</h2>
        <h3>Not running</h3>
        <p>The main cause of this is the computer is trying to run the old game on current hardware which this game being made in 1999, can have some trouble. We will reopen the properties option of the game icon. once there reselct compatibility and select the check box run in campatibility mode and choose windows xp service pack 3. Also disabling fullscreen optimizations may help if the previous doe snot fix.</p>
