        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Diablo 2 is quite an old game. But is still one of my favorite games to ever be created. Recently it had a patch go live to make it easier for people to install diablo on modern machines. Although these patches are not 100% fool proof so this guide will hopefully solve all your issues you may be having with installation.</p>
